Name of Quantlet : SFEStopLossThGraph

Published in : Statistics of Financial Markets I

Description : 'Generates and plots the path of two stocks and marks the theoretical buying and
selling time points in continuous time of a stop-loss hedging strategy'

Keywords : 'stop-loss, hedging, continuous, asset, black-scholes, call, simulation, cost, delta,
strategy'

Input: 
- S0_1: Stock price at t = 0 for first path
- S0_2: Stock price at t = 0 for second path
- sig: Volatility
- r: Risk free interest rate
- K: Strike price
- t0: Starting time (1 week = 1/52)
- mat: Maturity
- dt: Time period between steps.

Output : 'A plot of two simulated stocks with theoretical buy and sell times in comtinuous time
within the stop-loss hedging strategy.'
